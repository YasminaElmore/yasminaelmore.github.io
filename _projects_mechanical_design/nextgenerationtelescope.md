The goal of the sunshade project was to create a deployable system capable of spanning 20m x 20m in three layers, each consisting of 50μm-thick Kapton coated with 100nm aluminum. The system had to be stowed in a 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m volume, withstand thermal extremes from -269°C to +400°C, resist micrometeoroid damage, and operate with a total mass of less than 200kg. The design had to achieve a first-mode frequency above 0.1Hz to ensure sufficient stiffness upon deployment. The project was divided into two parts: design and construction, followed by verification and validation through a prototype that simulates the full-scale system. The membrane was designed using the origami flasher pattern for optimal stowing efficiency and smooth unfolding.


# Roles and Contributions

<h2>Design Contributions</h2>
<ul>
    <<li>Contributed to the development of deployable booms and the central hub, ensuring they met the mechanical and thermal requirements. Designed booms from Stanley FATMAX steel tape measures, ensuring a bistable deployment with a maximum length of 1.5 meters per boom and a deployment time of 4 seconds.</li>
    <li>Collaborated on the creation of the prototype, focusing on simulating full-scale deployment characteristics. The prototype was scaled down to 1/10th of the full-scale system to test deployment efficiency and structural integrity.</li>
    <li>Worked on optimizing folding patterns and stowing efficiency to ensure smooth deployment in a confined space. The folding pattern was optimized for a folding ratio of 1:3, reducing the required stowed volume to 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m.</li>
    <li><strong>Folding Pattern Design:</strong> Created a folding pattern for the flasher using Mathematica to optimize the membrane stowage efficiency, resulting in a stowed size of 50x50x10 cm.</li>
    <li><strong>Boom Design:</strong> Designed deployable booms using Stanley FATMAX steel tape measures with bistable properties. The final boom length, when deployed, is 3 meters, with a stowed length of 0.5 meters.</li>
    <li><strong>Central Hub Design:</strong> Designed a motor-driven central hub with a 100 mm diameter and a needle roller bearing to ensure smooth deployment and precise control of the boom movement.</li>
    <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Integrated all components for the deployment sequence, ensuring that the booms deploy in under 30 seconds from the stowed to fully extended configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verification and Validation Testing Contributions</h2>
    
<h3>Individual Testing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Buckling Test:</strong> Conducted incremental load tests on the prototype booms with applied weights ranging from 128g to 512g.
        <ul>
            <li>At 384g, initial signs of buckling were visible, and at 512g, Euler buckling occurred, causing the full structure to collapse.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Coiling/Uncoiling Test:</strong> Tested the repeatability and control of the coiling/uncoiling process:
        <ul>
            <li>Prototype booms were constructed with Stanley FATMAX steel tape, which allowed for a coiling and uncoiling cycle of 10 repetitions with no significant deformation or misalignment.</li>
            <li>Used Kapton tape markers along the boom to track motion, and no twisting or misalignment occurred after 10 full cycles of deployment and stowage.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Flasher Deployment Testing:</strong> Performed tests to ensure the flasher deployed in under 5 seconds and met mechanical stability requirements during deployment and stowage.</li>
    <li><strong>Central Hub Testing:</strong> Tested the central hub's integration with booms to ensure smooth rotation and deployment. It showed no signs of wear after 100 deployment cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall Testing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gravity Offload Testing:</strong> Simulated microgravity conditions using a system of four low-friction rails, each with low-friction carriages and counterweights.
        <ul>
            <li>Counterweights of 25 grams were used per boom tip to simulate microgravity forces, with the linear rails providing minimal resistance for smooth deployment.</li>
            <li>The system allowed for an extension time of 8 seconds for each boom, with smooth motion and minimal resistance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Further Testing and Adjustments</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Separation Distance Adjustments:</strong> 
    Adjusted the rail separation from 20 cm to 30 cm. The 30 cm configuration resulted in smoother deployment, while a 20 cm separation caused slight constrictions in movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine-Tuning of Counterweighting System:</strong> 
    Identified oscillations during the initial deployment phase. Fine-tuned the counterweights, which reduced oscillations by 40%, ensuring a smoother deployment process.</li>
</ul>

# Skills developed 

<ul>

    <li>Learned to apply origami-based folding patterns for efficient stowing and reliable deployment of large structures. Designed the sunshade to achieve a compact stowage ratio of 1:3.</li>
    <li>Developed practical skills in prototyping with cost-effective alternatives like PLA, Mylar, and Stanley FATMAX tape measures. Built a scaled prototype using these materials to test deployment mechanics.</li>
    <li>Enhanced my ability to test mechanical systems, identify failure modes, and refine design to improve reliability and performance. Conducted tests with weights ranging from 128g to 512g to understand structural performance under load.</li>
    <li>Strengthened project management and teamwork skills while addressing challenges in motor selection, material integration, and iterative design adjustments. Contributed to the development of the motor-driven central hub with 2.5 Nm torque output for boom deployment.</li>
