The project was realized in the Product Realization Lab at Stanford University, where I created a stamp using FLA (Fused Layer Additive) and SDM (Shape Deposition Manufacturing) printing with thermosets and thermoplastics.

<h2>Roles Played </h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product Design & CAD Modeling:</strong> Developed ergonomic and structurally sound 3D models using CAD software.</li>
    <li><strong>Material Selection & Optimization:</strong> Evaluated thermosets and thermoplastics (PETG, ABS, TPU, resins) to balance rigidity, comfort, and durability.</li>
    <li><strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</strong> Conducted static simulations to determine safety factors, stress distribution, and material performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Additive Manufacturing & Prototyping:</strong> Utilized FDM (TPU, PETG) and SLA (Flexible 80A) printing for high-precision and multimaterial designs.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural Testing & Validation:</strong> Assessed mechanical stability under applied forces, ensuring robustness in real-world usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Fastening & Assembly Design:</strong> Implemented heat-set inserts, screw connections, and multimaterial interfaces for enhanced assembly efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative Design Improvement:</strong> Enhanced ergonomic grip, reduced warping, and optimized attachment mechanisms for long-term usability.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Skills Developed </h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD):</strong> Created detailed parametric models for manufacturability.</li>
    <li><strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</strong> Conducted stress analysis to refine design under real-world loading conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>3D Printing & Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Worked with both FDM and SLA technologies for functional part production.</li>
    <li><strong>Material Science & Mechanical Properties:</strong> Analyzed stiffness, elasticity, and durability of engineering materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Manufacturing Process Selection:</strong> Optimized design for both additive and traditional manufacturing methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Human-Centered Design & Ergonomics:</strong> Focused on user comfort and usability in mechanical product design.</li>
    <li><strong>Fastening & Assembly Engineering:</strong> Designed and tested heat-set inserts, screw joints, and multimaterial bonding.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative Design & Performance Testing:</strong> Improved design based on physical testing and computational analysis.</li>
</ul>
