title: "Sail-Boom Subsystem Design for Large Scale Satellite"
date: 2024-12-01
description: Designed a deployable mebrane-boom system and developped a custom algorithm to find optimal preliminary design parameters that meets both stowed and deployed configurations of a large scale satellite

<p>
    The project discusses the design and analysis of subsystems present in large scale satellite, such as the membrane and the booms. The chosen booms are Bi-CTM booms, structural component often used in deployable space structures. The project focuses on material selection, geometric constraints, and mechanical performance such as buckling resistance, bending stiffness, and fundamental frequency. I also used past research to determine optimal materials and configurations, using carbon fiber composites for high stiffness-to-weight ratios. An algorithm is at the end suggested in roder to determine the design parameters, ensuring the boom meets deployment and structural requirements.
