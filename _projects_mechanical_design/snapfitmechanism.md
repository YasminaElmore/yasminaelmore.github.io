date: 2025-01-01
description: Designed a high-performance snap-fit through FEA, simulations, and iterative design, ensuring strength, durability, and manufacturability
---

<p>The project aims to optimize a snap-fit design by analyzing deflection limits and conducting FEA simulation, while improving safety factors and maintaining required performance under real-world loading conditions.</p>

<h3> Roles Played</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Performed structural analysis and force calculations to determine snap deflection and failure points.</li>
    <li>Conducted Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations to evaluate stress distribution and safety factors.</li>
    <li>Iterated on design parameters to optimize strength and manufacturability.</li>
    <li>Ensured the final design met performance requirements while maintaining a minimum safety factor above 1.5.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Skills Developed</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</strong> Simulated structural behavior under different load cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanical Failure Analysis:</strong> Identified weak points and optimized design to prevent failure.</li>
