# About 

This report summarizes an application of finite volume methods used to solve a 1D shallow water equations. To simulate a dam-break problem, we apply the Rusanov and HLL methods, considering different initial states and different size of grid cells. Finally, we consider the case of a topographic source term, showing the conservation of stationary states with zero velocity and applying the Rusanov method to simulate wave propagation.

# Skills developped

MATLAB, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Equation linearization, Rusanov method, HLL method, Riemann Problem
