# About

This project was realized for the French Physicists Tournament that took place in February 2023. The research was conducted in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at École Nationale Supérieure des Techniques Avancées (ENSTA) Paris between September 2022 and February 2023. This project focuses on solving an unsolved physics problem related to the behavior of spinning droplets and optimizing an experimental setup to maximize the rotational speed of the droplets.

# Role and Contribution 

<ul>
    <li>Responsible for the experimental setup using a 40,000 frames per minute high-speed camera to capture the droplet's rotational movement in real time with high accuracy.</li>
    <li>In charge of the data processing and analysis, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting relevant frames in videos. More than 100 videos were recorded, each containing over 9,000 images. </li>
            <li>Converting .raw videos format into a .tiff format compatible with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) using a MATLAB code.</li>
            <li>Tracking the rotational velocity of droplets post-impact using PIV image processing techniques.</li>
            <li>Performing post-processing analysis on MATLAB to identify patterns that influence the droplet’s behavior.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Collaborated with the research team to validate findings and refine the analysis methodology.</li>
    <li>Performed quality control checks to ensure the accuracy of the data during the experimental and processing phase.</li>
    <li>Contributed to the development of visual presentations and defended our theory in front of a panel of five judges for the French Physicists Tournament debate.</li>
</ul>
