# About

This project investigates the effects of rotation and surface roughness on the aerodynamics of a cylindrical profile through both theoretical analysis and experiments conducted in a wind tunnel. This project was carried out in collaboration between École Polytechnique and École Nationale Supérieure des Techniques Avancées (ENSTA) Paris. The focus of the project is to highlight the importance of validation in the engineering process, which links the theoretical study to experimentation. The latter represent two of the three pillars of engineering, the third being simulations.

# Role and Contribution 

<ul>
<li> Responsible for deriving key fluid flow parameters, including the lift coefficient, Reynolds number, and drag coefficients, using the conservation of mass, energy equations, and the velocity profile of the flow around a cylinder.</li>

<li>Defined and conducted experiments on a fixed cylinder of dimensions 14.5 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter at varying flow speeds (10 m/s, 15 m/s, and 20 m/s).</li>

<li>Conducted experiments on smaller cylinders of dimensions 13 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter and identified the effects of flow blockage and uncertainty caused by larger cylinders.</li>

<li>Performed experiments on a rotating cylinder, demonstrating the increase in lift by a factor of five due to rotation (called Magnus effect).</li>

<li> Conducted tests on a rough surface cylinder, revealing the impact of boundary layer separation and its effect on reducing lift.</li>

<li> Performed validation control test to ensure the accuracy of the data obtained. </li>
</ul>
